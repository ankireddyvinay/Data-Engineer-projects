# Brandname Generator 🏷️

A simple Python project that generates creative brand names by combining your city name and favorite pet!

## 📖 About This Project

This is my first Python project as I begin my programming journey! The idea is simple but fun - create unique brand names by combining two personal inputs from the user.

## 🚀 How It Works

The program will:
1. Ask you for your city name
2. Ask you for your favorite pet
3. Combine them to create a unique brand name
4. Display your personalized brand name

## 💻 Example

```
What city are you from? New York
What's your favorite pet? Dog
Your brand name is: New York Dog!
```

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Download the `Brandname_generator.py` file
3. Open terminal/command prompt
4. Navigate to the folder containing the file
5. Run: `python Brandname_generator.py`

## 📚 What I'm Learning

This project helps me practice:
- Taking user input with `input()`
